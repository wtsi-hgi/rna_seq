# RNASeq pipeline

The RNASeq pipeline, maintained by HGI.

Originally based on the [NF-Core RNASeq pipeline](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq),
it contains additional analysis modules extending the original pipeline.

The pipeline is actively used in the DavLab for all data processing and analysis.

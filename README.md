This is: 
* the old pipeline used to run davenport group data
* created by ip13 by cloning code created by gn5 and maintained by ad7
* kept here for continuity of processing
* should only be used for historical continuity
* new RNA projects should use modern nf-core pipeline: https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq

This pipeline is ment to be run in Nextflow Tower.
